Verify you use the right venv with
```bash

```
Install all the requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Start the training
Once everything is all set, you can start the training switching to your dedicated branch with
```bash
git checkout -b name-surname-branch
```

Then, you will need to manually install the PR Python Toolbox with

```bash
pip install pr-python-toolbox==3.1.0 --index-url https://pernod-ricard-python-data:{PAT}@pkgs.dev.azure.com/pernod-ricard-data/_packaging/pernod-ricard-python-data/pypi/simple/
```
Make sure you replace the {PAT} with a valid PAT created from [here](https://dev.azure.com/pernod-ricard-data/_usersSettings/tokens)

Once the toolbox installed, you can start the training with

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This should launch a new web page but if not, you can access the dashboard at [this url](http://localhost:8501/).
